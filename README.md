// Purpose:  This program receives a message of up to 40 bytes in ASCII format and a CRC-14 sequence of 15 bits
//           ones and zeros starting with a one. The input data ends with a carriage return.
//           The program then applies and appends this CR-12 (x^12 + x^11 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) to the message
//           followed by the CRC-14. The output is displayed in hexadecimal format.
